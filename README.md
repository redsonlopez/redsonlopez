# Hello!

I'm Hedson Lopes, a Data Scientist with a background in Data Science and a postgraduate student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
Currently, I’m interning at the City Hall of Belo Horizonte, working with data cleaning, analysis, and dashboards to support public decision-making.

I’m especially interested in:
- Machine Learning (supervised & unsupervised)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- SQL and data pipelines
- End-to-end projects, from analysis to deployment

Here you’ll find projects involving Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
